# The Rimon-Givon "Platinum" Demo Script

## Act I: The Hook (Roots)
**Action:** Click the **Granat (Index 0)** button.

**Narrative:** 
> "We start in the 19th century with Josek Hersz Granat. Look at the map—it doesn't just show a name; it takes us to Biezun, Poland. This is where the story begins. We’ve built this to be more than a list; it’s a geographical journey through our history."

## Act II: The Journey (The Cinematic Glide)
**Action:** Click **Diamentstein (Index 3)**.

**Narrative:** 
> "Watch the transition. As we move to Hungary to follow the Diamentstein sisters, the map glides smoothly. No jerky jumps—this is the cinematic experience the legacy deserves. We are tracking the family’s movement across borders in real-time."

## Act III: The Convergence (The Modern HQ)
**Action:** Click **Givon (Index 1)**. Wait for the map to land in Aljezur. Then, click **DUNICA (Index 5)**.

**Narrative:** 
> "Now, look at the present. This is the Givon branch in Portugal—Amir Heller and the family hub. Notice the coordinates. When I switch to DUNICA, the map stays fixed. Why? Because the family and our Biotech venture are now physically and conceptually one unit. This is the 'Aljezur Convergence.'"

## Act IV: The Flex (The Hand-off)
**Action:** Click the **"Mobile Share"** button in the footer. Let the QR code popup with the glassmorphism blur.

**Narrative:** 
> "I don't want you to just watch me. I want you to take this with you. Scan this QR code right now."

**The Reveal:** 
> "Notice that because I’m currently showing the Aljezur cluster, your phone will automatically fly to Portugal the moment the app opens. It’s stateful, it’s portable, and it’s live."

## Closing Note for the Boss
"This is the Platinum Build. It’s mobile-responsive, branded with our custom icon, and every single coordinate is verified against the family records. The legacy is safe in this code."
